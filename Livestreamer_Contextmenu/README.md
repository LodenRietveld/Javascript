#Addon for Firefox on Windows

Allows you to right-click on a stream from twitch to open it in VLC. This may defeat the purpose of Livestreamer being a command line tool, but it's still nice to circumvent the awful twitch player without having to blindly check for streams.

I don't know if I'll be adding support for other OSes or browsers. Maybe some day.
